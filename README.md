Hi, I’m Matt York—engineer, blockchain researcher, and creator of pflow.xyz, a Petri-net SDK for modeling complex systems.

## Mission

To explore and promote Petri nets as a universal modeling substrate for systems thinking, decentralized architecture, and human–AI collaboration — through open tools, minimal languages, and visual logic.

That means:

- Building tools like pflow.xyz to make Petri nets usable by anyone.

- Translating abstract ideas into visual, testable form.

- Connecting classical systems theory with the modern decentralized stack.

- And doing it all in the open — as much for teaching as for discovery.
